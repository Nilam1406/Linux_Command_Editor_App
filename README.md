# Linux Command Editor App

A new Flutter project.

An android based application using Flutter which will allow us to run Linux Commands through our android Mobile Phones. 
In actual for running Linux commands we use Redhat8 Operating System and it will required lots of storage space and time.
For Running Linux Commands we require Laptops with Redhat8 Linux installation, because of that lots of students unable to learn and practice linux commands.
Our Linux Command Editor will solve this problem, through our app we can run linux commands without any storage space and it will save lots of time also.
Through this app/editor we can run 80% of Linux Commands.
